# scaleTheTest

This is a website I built for my AP Chemistry teacher at Thomas Jefferson HS for Science and Tech, DR. Acio.

The county recently switched to a new gradebook system and my teacher had to resort to scaling all of our tests on paper,
a task that took a couple hours per assessment. 

Naturally, this seemed very inefficient to me, and I was prepared to do anything to help him curve our tests, I built this webapp 
for him and it is now live.

This was also a great way to practice my Web Dev chops, and learn how to write javascript code that does more than just cool animations.

PS I used the Polymer Project for this.
